cub3D

Description 
Goal of this project is to create an old fashion Wolfenstein3D-like engine. For rendering the walls as 3D objects,
raycasting will be the cornerstone of the project.

Instructions

To test this project, in order: 
- Clone this repo in a directory
- go to the root of the repo
- type 'make'
- use the executable with a pattern such as: './cub3D maps/test_map.cub'

Resources 

We've done a lot of research about raycasting and its utilities. The mathematical equations were quite complex so we had to read a bunch of resources and guides. Also AI supported us by understand the proofs of mathematical equtions and geometry of the project.
